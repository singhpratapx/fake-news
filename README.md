# Fake News Classifier

This repository contains code for classifying fake news articles using machine learning techniques. Detecting fake news is crucial in today's digital age to mitigate the spread of misinformation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project for training and testing the classifier is sourced from [mention source/website if applicable]. It consists of labeled news articles indicating whether they are fake or real.

## Project Structure

- **`data/`**: Directory to store the dataset (not included in this repo).
- **`src/`**: Contains the source code for the fake news classifier.
  - `fake_news_classifier.py`: Main script for training and evaluating the classifier.
  - `preprocessing.py`: Scripts for text preprocessing and feature extraction.
  - `model.py`: Contains the definition of the classifier model.
  - `utils.py`: Utility functions used in data loading, evaluation, etc.
- **`models/`**: Directory to save trained classifier models.
- **`results/`**: Folder to store evaluation results, confusion matrices, and other outputs generated by the scripts.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them using:

  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Usage

1. **Setup**: Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-news-classifier.git
   cd fake-news-classifier
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure all required libraries are installed.

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run Fake News Classifier**:

   ```
   python src/fake_news_classifier.py
   ```

   This script will preprocess the dataset, train the classifier model, evaluate its performance, and save the trained model in the `models/` directory. Evaluation results and other outputs will be stored in the `results/` directory.
